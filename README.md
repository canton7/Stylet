## Introduction

Stylet is a small but powerful ViewModel-first MVVM framework for WPF (.NET 4.5+ and .NET Core 3.0+), which allows you to write maintainable and extensible code in a way which is easy to test.
Stylet's aims are to:

- Solve the blockers, niggles, and annoyances which hamper MVVM development without a framework, using simple but powerful concepts.
- Be obvious to people picking up your project for the first time: there's very little magic
- Be easy to verify/validate. The LOC count is low, and it comes with a very comprehensive test suite. The code is well-written and well-documented.
- Be flexible while providing sensible defaults. Almost any part of the framework can be overridden if you wish, but you probably won't want to.

It is inspired by [Caliburn.Micro](http://caliburnmicro.com/), and shares many of its concepts, but removes most of the magic (replacing it with more powerful alternatives), and simplifies parts considerably by targeting only MVVM, WPF and .NET 4.5.

## Getting Started

### .NET 5.0+ / .NET Core

For .NET Core and .NET 5.0+ projects, the quickest way to get started is by using `dotnet new` with Stylet's template.

Open a command window where you want to create your new project, and install the Stylet templates using:

```
dotnet new -i Stylet.Templates
```

Then create a new .NET 6.0 project with:

```
dotnet new stylet -n MyStyletProject
```

(changing `MyStyletProject` as appropriate).
If you want to create a .NET 5.0 project, then:

```
dotnet new stylet -F net5.0-windows -n MyStyletProject
```

If you want to create a .NET Core 3.1 project, then:

```
dotnet new stylet -F netcoreapp3.1 -n MyStyletProject
```

If you want to set up your project manually, install the [Stylet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Stylet) package, then follow the instructions in the [Quick Start](https://github.com/canton7/Stylet/wiki/Quick-Start).

Stylet requires .NET 5.0+ or .NET Core 3.0+.

### .NET Framework (<= .NET 4)

For .NET Framework projects, the quickest way to get started is to create a new "WPF Application" project, then install the NuGet package [Stylet.Start](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Stylet.Start).
This will install Stylet, and set up a simple skeleton project.

See [Quick Start](https://github.com/canton7/Stylet/wiki/Quick-Start) for more details.

If you want to set up your project manually, install the [Stylet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Stylet) package, then follow the instructions in the [Quick Start](https://github.com/canton7/Stylet/wiki/Quick-Start).

Stylet requires .NET 4.5 (Visual Studio 2012 or higher).
